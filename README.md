# Advent of code 2021

My solutions to [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021) in typescript.

Generate the files that need to be created for a new day and add to the relevant lookup using:
```
npm run setup X
```

To run the solutions, start by building the project in watch mode with:
```
npm run build-watch
```

Then to run the solutions for a particular day run:
```
npm run start X
```

Or to run the example cases for a particular day run:
```
npm run test X
```

Just the first or second part of the problem can be run by using one of the following options:
```
npm run start X a
npm run start X b
npm run test X a
npm run test X b
```
